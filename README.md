# Hey there 👋

I'm Ami, from São Paulo - Brazil 🇧🇷 and living in Berlin - Germany 🇩🇪 . I am an ex-Art Director and Community Manager, now studying to become a Front-End Developer. I've gratudated from Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp in June 2020, and I am currently a Teacher Assistant for the next batches in Berlin. I am working hard on developing my skills so I can land my first job as a Front-End developer.

**Please check my [full CV](https://ami-onodera.github.io/resume/resume.html) and my [portfolio](https://ami-onodera.github.io/resume/portfolio.html)!**

In my free time I like to play videogames 🎮 , to watch movies 🎞️ , series 📺 , and animes 🌸 , to read books 📚 and to sew 👗 . You can see some of my favorites on ["Amiflix"](https://amiflix.vercel.app)! 🤓

## Current Status 👩‍💻
I am now focusing on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and React, as I take the [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/certificates/2714975085b0a1541b7aa4db7bebb93d) JavaScript and React workshops during the day and the [Front-end Web Development](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin-career-program) course at the **ReDi School of Digital Integration** in the evenings.

I am also participating on the [Full Stack Open](https://github.com/ami-onodera/full-stack-open-2020) program from the **University of Helsinki**. 🎯


I am looking for my first job as a Junior Front-End developer and open to opportunities in Berlin area or remote. 🙌
