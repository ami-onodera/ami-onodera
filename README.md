# Hey there 👋

I'm Ami, from São Paulo - Brazil 🇧🇷 and living in Berlin - Germany 🇩🇪 . I am an ex-Art Director and Community Manager, now studying to become a Front-End Developer. I've gratudated from Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp in June 2020, and I am currently a Teacher Assistant for the next batches in Berlin. I am working hard on developing my skills so I can land my first job as a Front-End developer.

Please check my [full CV](https://ami-onodera.github.io/resume/resume.html) and my [portfolio](https://ami-onodera.github.io/resume/portfolio.html)!

In my free time I like to play videogames 🎮 , to watch movies 🎞️ , series 📺 , and animes 🌸 , to read books 📚 and to sew 👗 . You can see some of my favorites on ["Amiflix"](https://amiflix.vercel.app)! 🤓

### Current Status 👩‍💻
I am now focusing on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and React, as I take the [SheCodes Plus and SheCodes React](https://www.shecodes.io/certificates/2714975085b0a1541b7aa4db7bebb93d) workshops and participate on the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en#course-contents) program from the **University of Helsinki**.
