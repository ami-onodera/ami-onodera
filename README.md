I'm Ami, from São Paulo - Brazil 🇧🇷  and living in Berlin - Germany 🇩🇪 . I am an ex-Art Director and Community Manager, now studying to become a Front-End Developer. I've gratudated from Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp in June 2020, and I am currently a Teacher Assistant for the next batches in Berlin, Brasília and Rio de Janeiro. I am working hard on developing my skills so I can land my first job as a Front-End developer.

## Current Status <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QWpIhanH9vo5wgAo7O/giphy.gif" width="80">
My focus now is on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and React, as I take the [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/certificates/2714975085b0a1541b7aa4db7bebb93d) workshops during the day and the [Front-end Web Development](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin-career-program) course at the **ReDi School of Digital Integration** in the evenings.

In addition to that, I am also participating on the [Full Stack Open](https://github.com/ami-onodera/full-stack-open-2020) program from the **University of Helsinki**. 🎯
