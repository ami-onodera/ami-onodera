### Hi there 👋

I'm Ami, from São Paulo - Brazil 🇧🇷 and living in Berlin - Germany 🇩🇪 . I am an ex-Art Director and Community Manager, now studying to become a Front-End Developer. I've gratudated from Le Wagon's full-stack web development bootcamp in June 2020, and I am currently a Teacher Assistant for the next batches in Berlin.
